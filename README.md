# Kubernetes-Based Microservices Architecture

This project demonstrates a production-grade microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes. The system implements modern cloud-native practices with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and operational efficiency.

## Kubernetes Architecture

The deployment architecture is organized using Kustomize for environment-specific configurations:

### Base Configuration
- **Namespaces**: Isolated environments for different components
- **Deployments**: Stateless application services
- **StatefulSets**: Database and other stateful services
- **Services**: Internal and external service definitions
- **ConfigMaps**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Secrets**: Secure credential management
- **Ingress**: External access management
- **Storage**: Persistent volume management

### Environment Overlays
- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Live environment with production-grade configurations

## Service Components

### Frontend Service
- Next.js application containerized for Kubernetes
- Horizontal scaling support
- Resource limits and requests defined
- Health check endpoints
- ConfigMap-based environment configuration

### Backend Microservices
- Go-based microservices with gRPC support
- Independent scaling capabilities
- Service mesh integration ready
- Resource optimization for container environments
- Graceful shutdown handling

### API Gateway (KrakenD)
- Request routing and aggregation
- Rate limiting and circuit breaking
- Security policy enforcement
- Load balancing configuration
- High availability setup

### Database Layer
- PostgreSQL StatefulSet deployment
- Persistent volume management
- Automated backups
- High availability configuration
- Resource optimization

## Kubernetes Features
