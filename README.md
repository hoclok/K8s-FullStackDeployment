## Project Overview

The **K8s-FullStackDeployment** project demonstrates how to effectively build and deploy a microservices architecture using Kubernetes. It incorporates various components and services that work together seamlessly. The architecture is designed to handle real-world applications, ensuring reliability and performance.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service operates independently, allowing for easy updates and scaling.
- **API Gateway**: Manages requests to different services, improving security and performance.
- **ConfigMaps**: Stores configuration data, separating it from application code.
- **Deployment Management**: Simplifies the deployment process and maintains application availability.
- **StatefulSets**: Manages stateful applications, ensuring data persistence.
- **Ingress Management**: Provides a way to manage external access to services.
- **Persistent Volumes**: Ensures data durability across pod restarts.
- **ReplicaSet Management**: Maintains a stable set of replica pods for high availability.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale services up or down based on demand.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **API Gateway**: Uses **Krakend** to route requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Microservices**: Built with **Golang** and **gRPC** for efficient communication.
- **Frontend**: Developed with **Next.js**, providing a responsive user interface.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates all components, managing deployments, scaling, and networking.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes **Persistent Volumes** to ensure data is stored reliably.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture:

## Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Golang**: Programming language for backend services.
- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC framework.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **Krakend**: API Gateway for microservices.
- **ConfigMap**: Kubernetes object to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.
- **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful applications in Kubernetes.
- **Persistent Volume**: Storage resource in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **K8s-FullStackDeployment** project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoclok/K8s-FullStackDeployment.git
   cd K8s-FullStackDeployment
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have **Docker** and **Kubernetes** installed. Use the following commands to install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Build the Services**:
   Build the Docker images for the microservices:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-image-name .
   ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   Apply the Kubernetes manifests:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Use the Ingress controller to access the application. The default URL is:
   ```
   http://your-domain.com
   ```

## Deployment

The deployment process is streamlined using Kubernetes. The manifests in the `k8s/` directory define the necessary resources, including Deployments, Services, and Ingress rules. 

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Prepare Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure your cluster is up and running.
2. **Apply Manifests**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
3. **Monitor the Deployment**: Use the following command to check the status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: After deployment, access the application through the Ingress URL.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the various services. The API Gateway handles requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices. 

### API Endpoints

- **User Service**: `/api/users`
- **Product Service**: `/api/products`
- **Order Service**: `/api/orders`

You can use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test the endpoints.
